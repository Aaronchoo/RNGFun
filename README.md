# RNG FUN
Using what I've learned through Udacity basic tutorials and link it to multiple projects with different focus. 
Just trying to have fun learning and exploring what I can do! 
Learned and used the following:
LinearLayout/RelativeLayout, 
Math.Random(), 
onClick and OnClickListener, 
EditText inputs/Buttons, 
Draw images, 
Utilize styles/colors to save time and be efficient, 
Intents, 
Substrings, 
Editing title/header, 
Custom java classes, 
Use of list/grid and OnClickItemListener, and
Manipulating the positions in the list/arraylist.
