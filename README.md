# LearningAndAdapting
Trying to implement what I've learned through Udacity basic tutorials and link it to RNG.
Just trying to have fun learning and exploring what I can do!
May change up the idea but majority of the activities will have parts of RNG while lnking back to information and skilled learned through lessons.
