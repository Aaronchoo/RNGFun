# LearningAndAdapting
Trying to implement what I've learned through Udacity basic tutorials and link it to multiple projects with different focus. 
Just trying to have fun learning and exploring what I can do!
May change up the idea but majority of the activities will have parts of RNG while lnking back to information and skilled learned through lessons. 
Learned and used the following:
LinearLayout/RelativeLayout,
Math.Random(),
onClick and OnClickListener,
EditText inputs/Buttons,
Draw images,
Utilize styles/colors to save time and be efficient,
Intents,
Substrings,
Editing title/header
Custom java classes
Use of list/grid and OnClickItemListener
Manipulating the positions in the list/arraylist
